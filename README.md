PC X64 Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the FASM assembler by Privalov (Tomasz Grysztar):<br />
https://flatassembler.net/<br />
I have included Windows 64-bit executables of all the demos.<br />
<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single executable (DEMONAME.exe) file for Windows.<br />
Using FASM open up DEMONAME.asm & click the Run/Compile button.<br />
Howto Run:<br />
Tested using Windows 10.<br />
Double click the DEMONAME.exe in the File Explorer, or Run the demo within FASM by clicking the Run/Run button.
